I am currently a Staff Engineer and Team Lead in Alibaba Group, working on Autonomous Driving

From 2017 to 2021, I worked as a Research Scientist and Principle Investigator (PI) at the Institute of Infocomm Research, A\*STAR. I have joint appointments and lead team in Institute of High Performance Computing and A\*STAR Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I am the PI and Co-PI of several research and Industrial projects. I also supervise PhD, FYP and Intern students from local and overseas Universities. My research interests include Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, task and motion planning. I received the B.Eng degree with First Class Honor from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2010; and the M.S. and  Ph.D. degree from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 2014 and 2017 respectively.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->
